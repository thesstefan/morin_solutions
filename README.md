# Solution Manual

My own solution manual for David J. Morin's [Probability: For the Enthusiastic Beginner](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/probability)
exercises. The manual is written using LaTeX and the PDF file can be accessed at [`morin_solutions.pdf`](https://github.com/thesstefan/morin_solutions/tree/master/build/morin_solutions.pdf).
